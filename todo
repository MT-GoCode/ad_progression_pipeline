Tasks by priority
Critical, by next meeting:
- implement rnn pipeline up to TEST
- implement xgboost
- other feature selectors
- other rebalancers (random resampling)
- kick off all pipelines
- no smote during inference RF
- make sure info about which columns are cat, ord, etc. informs later models
- yaml file specifies optuna run (pruning, number of trials)
- kick off all runs

- implement data cleaning ops, columnar transforms, progression, columns, etc.
    - i'll deal with specific column stuff -- keep this one, drop that, etc. once ruslan rebuilds the beginning part.
    - Smote-TS rebalancing
- metrics, gotta have balanced accuracy and rnn confusion matrix. What's nice though is because models are serialized, you can create new metrics whenever you want.

Next
- create testing metrics artifact (done)
- create deserialization functions
- create testing pipeline independent of training
- organize data folder by pipeline type
- SIGINT handler
- plotting optuna results
- continue training run pipeline
- optuna pruning

Pipelining
- df caching
- enforce keyword args
- yaml file specifies which pipeline (done)


Questions
- Which progression column
